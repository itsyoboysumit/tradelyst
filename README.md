# Tradelyst Frontend

Tradelyst is a **frontend-only learning project** I created to understand the structure and workflow of large-scale websites. This project focuses on clean code organization, reusable components, and responsive design using React.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

* To practice **large project structuring** with multiple pages and modular components.
* To strengthen my **React skills** by building reusable UI elements (Navbar, Footer, Hero, etc.).
* To learn how to manage **routing and navigation** across pages such as Home, About, Pricing, Product, Signup, and Support.
* To simulate a **real-world frontend workflow** while keeping scalability and maintainability in mind.
